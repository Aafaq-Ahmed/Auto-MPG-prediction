## Predicting the Fuel consumption of cars

**The basic idea of analysing the Auto mpg dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the aggregate fuel consumption of each car.**  

**Cars of different variants of different models of various Car manufacturing companies from origin countries such as USA, Japan and Europe.**

**Fuel consumption of car is affected by various factors such as Model year, Horsepower, Number of Cylinders present, displacement, Weight and Acceleration of the car.**

**We need to find which factors mostly affect the Fuel consumption of a car in order to improve the mpg value.**

**Hence build a model to predict the mpg value of each car.**
